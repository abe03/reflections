How did viewing a diff betwen two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?
-It help me by allowing me to focus only on the text that had recently
changed instead of having to go through the whole text, so it was easier
to catch a simple typo by a having a higher focus on a samller area.

How could having easy acces to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient progammer in the long term?
-Being able to go back and look at past versions of our work could help
us by going back in case we make mistakes on our recent version which could be found by looking at the old versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-I think the pros of choosing when to create a commit are that you can make sure that your changes aren't too small where it would make it difficutl to understand the changes later on. The cons are that you might forget to do it often and might end up with very sparce changes which would hold too much of a difference and would be hard to make sense of it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-They allow you to save multiple files in a single commit because these files tend to be related to each other, so changes in a file probably affect the other files too. In other version control systems this might not be the case, and most of the files they manage are independent from each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-You can use git log to view each of the commits that have been submited and then git diff to see the difference among each updated version on each commit which allows you to see how the files change overtime.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-I would be more confident in the way that i know if i make a big mistkae i can always be safe by being able to restore and older version, so i wouldn't be so advert to making big changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-I would like to keep working with reporsitories as with all the added new features i'm sure it will be easier to do so.
